# Welcome to Raid Coding

**Raid Coding** is a platform where developers, DevOps specialists, database engineers, machine learning engineers, and others (referred to as **"raiders"**), either individually or by forming groups and guilds, can compete in implementing randomly or manually selected projects under certain conditions, such as development approaches, time constraints, technologies, and many others. The created projects are rated by specially selected judges and other raiders!
